# L'Aventure Cinema

L'Aventure Cinema is an app for movie theater management to list movies in theater, employee favorites, and upcoming films to the theater.

This application is a the first application built with Ruby on Rails as a part of the General Assembly Web Development Immersive Remote course 2017-2018. It was a group project and authors are listed below.

## Approach

The project started with researching and selecting which available movie APIs. OMBD was a well known resource that we wanted to use, but because of its limitations in how you can query for movies, we decided against using it. It would have forced users to type in the exact full title of a movie, and it only displayed one result at a time. We decided it would be best for users to enter in their own data, and determined movie theater management would be adept at doing so.

## User Stories
* As a browser of the app, I want to see what movies are playing at the theater.
* As a browser of the app, I want to see what movies are upcoming.
* As an admin of the app, I want to list which films are currently playing at the theater, top-ranked movies by employees, and upcoming movies.
* As an admin of the app, I want to update, remove, and create movies on the app.

## Unsolved problems/features
* Adding in a third-party API
* Showcasing different actors in the movies
* Filter movies by awards won
